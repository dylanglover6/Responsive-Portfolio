      <p>Hello! My name is Dylan Glover, and I am a 22 year old student of the UT Austin Coding Bootcamp. I enrolled in this course with beginner level skills in computer programming, but I am determined to acquire the knowledge and expertise to master this skill and begin a new career path in coding! I was previously enrolled in classes at Austin Community College up until this previous semester. I was studying for a career in Radio Television and Film, but decided it was not the career path I desired to continue down. After finishing the UT Austin Coding Bootcamp, I am planning to return to Austin Community College to finish up a degree in Computer Science or a related field while also searching for a job.</p>

      <p>I was born in Dallas, Texas and have lived in Austin for about 4 years now. In my free time, I enjoy spending time with my dog, Fawn, and my girlfriend, Madison. When the weather is nice I enjoy hiking on the Greenbelt and often taking camping trips with my friends. I also spend time playing video games and enjoying films. Thanks for taking the time to get to know me, and enjoy your time viewing my portfolio!</p>
